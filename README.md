# Unsupervised_Machine_Learning

Project by: Mirto Gasparinatou - Marina Bylash - Iason Loxos-Andreou

This project was conceived within the framework of the Data Science Bootcamp 2023-2024 at Big Blue Data Academy.

We explore a dataset containing numerous data features from the customers of a SuperMarket such as Age, Marital status, Income, Number of children and their age, Product preferences, Number of deals purchased and more.

Our aim is to construct a clustering model to categorize customers, recognize their needs and habits per cluster so the supermarket's marketing team has a better chance to incude them in their deals and offers and maximize sales.
